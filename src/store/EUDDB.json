Look at the X pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor and\nwrite it down.\n\n3. Look at the Y pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor\nand write it down.\n\n4. Now plug those numbers into this formula:\nMemory at Death Table + 3312 is exactly (3145792 + (((Start Location X * 16777216) + (Start Location Y * 256)) * 256) + (4194352 * 65536) + (805322752 * 16777216))\n\n3145792, 4194352, and 805322752 are \"constants,\" that you need to know and account for in the equation. Because EPD reads 4 bytes at once (this formula does not work for Player 1 and Player 2 Start Location. If you understood everything that was said so far, then coming up with another formula that's specific to those two will be easy).\n\n5. The trigger should work, and if it doesn't, then either you have miscalculated or these \"unknowns\", are not constant.\n\nChallenge - Find out what those unknowns are actually for, and/or create an easier formula than the one I have come up with."

            "The button set ID of the currently selected single unit. There is a 1-to-1 relationship between unit ID and it's button set, eg the buttonset for terran ghost is ID 1.\n\nThere are also several group buttonsets, for when multiple workers, or burrowable, or cloakable units etc selected:\n* 244 - generic units, shows move/stop/attack/guard/patrol buttons\n* 245 - workers, shows move/stock/attack + gather and return resources buttons\n* 246 - cloakable units, as per 'generic' + cloak/decloak buttons\n* 247 - burrowable units, as per 'generic' + burrow/unburrow buttons\n\nRefer to button tabs in Firegraft.\n\nThrough experimentation, buttons occasionally have a delay of up to 2-3 seconds before changes in game state will update the button status (eg when a new tech is available, a button that relies on that tech may stay greyed out for 2-3 seconds). Setting this address with a different value (eg 244) is a way to force a refresh for the currently displayed button set.\n\nNote that SC constantly updates this address to reflect the current unit's actual button set, to prevent units from being able to action commands that they shouldn't have access to (the infamous 1.13 patch series to stop any building from making any unit)."
